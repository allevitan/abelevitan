###Who am I?

I'm a Junior at [Olin College](http://olin.edu/) majoring in [Engineering Physics][EPhys].

###What do I do?

While Engineering Physics could mean almost anything, in practice I spend about half my time studying physics and half my time doing engineering. I mostly do electrical and computer engineering, but I've worked on the mechanical side for a number of projects as well.

###What else do I do?

I can often be found making coffee and tea, spinning fire, or working on some new crazy [project](/projects/) of mine.
