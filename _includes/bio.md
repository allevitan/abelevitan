###Who am I?

I'm a sophomore at [Olin College](http://olin.edu/) majoring in [Engineering Physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics).

###What do I actually do for that?

While in Engineering Physics could mean almost anything, in practice I split my time about evenly between classes in physics, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. If that clarifies anything at all.

###What other things do I do?

I can often be found making coffee and tea, spinning fire, or working on some crazy [project](/projects/).
