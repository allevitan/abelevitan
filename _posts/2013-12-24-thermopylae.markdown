**King Leonidas of Sparta** (the [defender of Thermopylae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae)) was designed by [Claire Diehl](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/claire-diehl/7b/b07/a6b), [Erin Pierce](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/erin-pierce/86/117/3b7), [Marena Richardson](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/marena-richardson/71/638/488), and I as our final project for Principles of Engineering.

Unlike a normal water sprinkler which only gets you wet some of the time, the defender of Themopylae uses computer vision to make sure that you get wet every time. It uses an off-the-shelf [impact sprinkler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_sprinkler), a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), 2 sail-winch servos, and a [Raspberry Pi Camera Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11868).

I designed the servo mount and the gearbox used to control the range of the sprinkler, helped spec the electrical parts, and sacrificed my body to test the finished product on a freezing December day.

The full documentation is on the project's [website](http://defenderofthermopylae.weebly.com/), the code is up on [Github](http://github.com/allevitan/Thermopylae), and the CAD is up on [GrabCAD](http://grabcad.com/library/auto-targeting-sprinkler-1).
